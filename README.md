# Tanks-Game
A game of tanks made within Python.

This was made for a computing project at college.

It'll either be abandoned in its current unfinished state (18-11-2016 DD-MM-YYYY) or I'll fix it up later, but much less cleanly that it would be.

## Requirements
This requires Python v3.5, with a relevantly installed version of Pygame. If cloning from source, the `Data` folder requires only `rectOne.png` and `rectTwo.png` plus a non-empty `Levels` folder inside of that.

## Running
To run the main game, you just run the `Main_.py` file. This should work. Controller support is commented out, but is certainly there. Just uncomment line 15 of the main file.

To run the mapmapker, just run `MapMakerMain.py`. Click once to select one position, click again to select another, and a box will be drawn. Scroll up on a box to change it's colour, and scroll down to delete it. Middle click sets the location of one tank, and right click sets the other.
